# Singals Design Project
Q1. Design a narrowband FIR filter using the interpolated finite impulse response (IFIR)technique. The filter should meet the following specifications:

Passband edge: 3600 Hz
Stopband edge: 3200 Hz
Sampling frequency: 8000 Hz
Pass-band ripple <= 0.01
Stopband ripple <= 0.0001
Design the filter using Matlab command: "ifir"
(a) Find an optimal interpolation factor, M.
(b) Find bandedges of bandedge shaping filter Ha(z) and masking filter HMa(z).
(c) Calculate the filter lengths of bandedge shaping filter and masking filter.
(d) Design the filter using "ifir". What are the final filter lengths for bandedge shaping filter and
masking filter? Are they the same as calculated values in (c)?
(e) Plot the frequency response of interpolated bandedge shaping filter, masking filter, and
overall filter.
